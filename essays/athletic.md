	I start the first week of my first software engineering class already fidgety and jumpy. After taking a semester off, I had decided to throw myself into the deep end and load up my class schedule despite my own trepidation about my own preparedness. And there I was, fidgeting with my laptop, when the course pedagogy and schedule was explained, this course was probably going to be intense.  It’s called Athletic software engineering, and it’s going to the bane of my existence for the next sixteen weeks.
 
	We are going to approach the semester in weeklong modules with specific activities and intense deadlines. One of the most important activities is the workout of the day (WOD), which is a problem-solving exercise that we need to solve efficiently within a set time limit. We get practice WODs as homework to do on our own, a group WOD to practice in collaboration with at least one other student, optional TA WODs that we can practice outside of class. This all leads to “game day”. The in-class WOD concludes our module for the week and count towards grading. This approach is modeled after the training structure that of athletic disciplines. It intends to help students take their training seriously (get their coding “reps” in) to increase their odds of performing satisfactorily when it counts.
 
	And I’ll admit thus far this program is keeping me on my toes. It forces me to push through my inclination for procrastination and buckle down to learn the material and practice it repeatedly. I am stressed all the time, I am constantly on edge, and I’ve never absorbed new information and skills this efficiently. One week may be a bit early to make sweeping statements, but I think that this style of learning is going to work for me. Usually, I am good at learning material, but my recall is horrible. It’s up there, I swear, it just takes a minute for the request for access to any information to go through. This learning method helps me work passed this person quirk via timed nature of the WODs. Yes, the timer freaks me out. But the timer also forces me to develop efficient methods to tackle the kinds of problems that I may encounter in “the real world”. It is also intensely satisfying to complete a WOD within the prescribed time limit.
 
	While the emotional ups and downs of athletic software engineering seem daunting, I am cautiously excited about the potential benefits that it may bring to the table. This unique approach has compelled me to work through my procrastination and embrace a disciplined approach to learning. This semester may be challenging, but I believe the headaches are worth the growth and development that are just within my reach.
