Title: Exploring the Impact of AI in ICS 314: A Reflective Essay

## I. Introduction

Artificial Intelligence (AI) has become a transformative force in various fields, including education. In the context of Software Engineering, the integration of AI tools and methodologies has reshaped the learning landscape. This essay reflects on my personal experiences with AI in ICS 314, exploring the influence of AI on my understanding and application of software engineering principles. 

## II. Personal Experience with AI:

1. Experience WODs
   For experience WODs I would try to do them on my own to facilitate my own learning. If on the second attempt I hit a roadblock, I would make an inquiry to ChatGPT to set me on the right path. 

2. In-class Practice WODs:
   In-class practice WODs often involved quick problem-solving. AI was sparingly used, as immediate personal comprehension was prioritized. AI might slow down the learning process in such scenarios. In-class WODs were also the way for me to assess where in the unit I needed to study extra before the In-Class WOD.

3. In-class WODs:
   AI, particularly ChatGPT, was occasionally consulted for complex WODs. I would leverage ChatGPT by asking, for example, "Write a function using underscore to implement the following instructions." The AI provided a starting point, but refinement was necessary. The benefit was guidance, but the cost was the need for extensive trial and error. The trade-off was the time spent refining AI-generated solutions to meet specific requirements.

4. Essays:
   AI played a limited role in essay writing. At most I would ask ChatGPT for potential subjects or outlines. But I would do the major heavy lifting of the actual writing as one of the things encouraged would be creativity.

5. Final Project:
   So far the only way Iâ€™ve used AI for the final project is to help debug, or to explain error messages to me.

6. Learning a Concept / Tutorial:
   AI was rarely used during tutorials, as hands-on learning was prioritized. Active engagement with concepts proved more effective for comprehension.

7. Answering a Question in Class or in Discord:
   AI was occasionally used to gather initial information. However, reliance on personal knowledge and class discussions prevailed to deepen understanding.

8. Asking or Answering a Smart Question:
   AI was employed for background research. However, formulating thoughtful questions or answers required a deeper understanding facilitated by traditional learning methods.

9. Coding Example
   AI played a supportive role in providing examples, but the critical understanding came from personal analysis and application.

10. Explaining Code:
	AI's assistance was sought for explanations when in the rare instance that the online course material was not clear.

11. Writing Code:
	AI, specifically Co-Pilot, proved valuable for suggesting code snippets. However, the human touch in structuring and optimizing code was indispensable.

12.Documenting Code:
	AI was not extensively used for code documentation, as it required a nuanced understanding of the project, which AI lacked.

13. Quality Assurance 
	AI's role in quality assurance was supplementary. Human judgment was pivotal in identifying nuanced errors.

14. Other Uses in ICS 314 not listed:
	AI was occasionally used for brainstorming and generating ideas. However, the application was limited due to the need for context and relevance.

## III. Impact on Learning and Understanding:

The incorporation of AI in ICS 314 has significantly impacted my learning experience. While AI accelerated certain aspects of problem-solving, the true understanding and mastery of software engineering concepts were achieved through hands-on engagement, discussions, and personal exploration. AI provided valuable guidance but could not replace the depth of comprehension gained through traditional learning methods.

## IV. Practical Applications:

Outside ICS 314, AI found practical applications in real-world projects and collaborative activities, such as the Hawaii Annual Code Challenge (HACC). AI demonstrated effectiveness in addressing specific challenges, showcasing its potential in enhancing collaborative software engineering endeavors.

## V. Challenges and Opportunities:

Challenges encountered in using AI included the need for extensive refinement, potential time inefficiencies, and limitations in nuanced understanding. Opportunities lie in refining AI tools to provide more tailored solutions and incorporating AI in collaborative projects for efficient problem-solving.

## VI. Comparative Analysis:

Comparatively, traditional teaching methods fostered deeper engagement, knowledge retention, and practical skill development. While AI offered valuable support, it fell short in providing the holistic understanding achieved through interactive learning, discussions, and individual exploration.

## VII. Future Considerations:

The future role of AI in software engineering education holds promise. Advancements should focus on refining AI tools to complement, not replace, traditional teaching methods. Emphasizing critical thinking and problem-solving skills alongside AI integration will be crucial for comprehensive learning experiences.

## VIII. Conclusion:

In conclusion, the integration of AI in ICS 314 provided a unique perspective on software engineering education. While AI proved valuable in specific scenarios, the synergy with traditional teaching methods is essential. Striking a balance between AI support and human-centric learning approaches will optimize the integration of AI in future courses, fostering a comprehensive and enriching educational experience.
