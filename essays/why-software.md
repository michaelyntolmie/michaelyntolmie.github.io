Why do I want to study computer science? That’s a pretty good question really. I never dreamed of working with computers as a child or teen. In fact, little me wanted to be a librarian (until she learned that librarians did other things besides read and recommend books all day). To be completely honest, I started down this path because I was waffling on what I wanted to do with my future and this seemed like the most pragmatic choice. I figured at the very least, I would come out of my computer science program with a plethora of practical tools and skills and I’d be able to market myself as a diligent worker. 

But now that I actually understand what is going on, I’m enjoying the challenge of learning the course work. It turns out that I like the problem-solving aspect of computer science. I’m enjoying breaking down complex problems into small manageable bits and designing solutions basically from nothing. I’ve learned that this kind of analytical thinking and logical problem solving is intensely gratifying to me. 

So I entered this program expecting to slog through with my head down, nose to the grindstone. And much to my surprise I am finding joy in the challenge. I’m excited to learn new programming languages and more about algorithms, data structures, and software architecture. I also hope that by completing this program I can find a niche that I can joyfully occupy in this field.
