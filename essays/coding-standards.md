Coding standards are often disregarded as trivial nitpicking that dictate mundane aspects of code formatting, such as indentation and brace placement. But I’ve come to believe that coding standards are far from trivial and are actually integral to software development.

## Consistency and Readability 
One of the most obvious benefits of coding standards is consistency. When all team members adhere to the same set of coding standards, it becomes easier to read and understand code shared by others. Readable code is crucial for effective collaboration and the maintenance of software over time. If all team members worked on a project and each member used their own code style it would be a nightmare to decipher each other's work or to maintain it over time.

## Error Reduction
Coding standards can also help prevent common programming errors. For example, indentation can reveal code blocks and nesting errors at a glance. The use of proper naming conventions makes it easier to identify variables and functions, reducing the frequency of using the wrong identifier. 

## Learning and Language Proficiency
Another possible boon of using coding standards is an increase of language proficiency. My personal experience in this area is that when I adhere to coding standards, I’m forced to immerse myself in that language’s syntax and best practices. Consistently following these standards reinforces my understanding of the language. On the other hand, reading code that adheres to standards can serve as a learning resource when I’m starting to study a new language. 

## Conclusion
Coding standards are far from fussy mundane busywork; they are a fundamental aspect of software engineering that impacts your code’s quality, readability, and error reduction. Consistently adhering to coding standards can even help improve proficiency and understanding of a programming language. So though it may feel like a waste of time and energy to make your code adhere to standards the benefits make the effort worthwhile.
