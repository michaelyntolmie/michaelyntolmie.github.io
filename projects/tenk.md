summary: "A practice in dedication and incremental training."
---
In 2019 I completed a 10k race after training for several months. 
Preparing for a 10k run and pursuing a degree in computer science both require dedication and a systematic approach. Here's a condensed version:

1. Goal Setting: Set clear objectives for the run and the degree.

2. Planning and Research: Create a training schedule and research running techniques for the run, and understand the curriculum and courses for the degree.

3. Incremental Training: Gradually increase running distance for the run and learn computer science concepts step by step.

4. Consistency and Practice: Regularly train for the run and study for the degree.

5. Adaptation and Growth: Adjust training routines and learn from challenges in both running and computer science.

6. Support and Community: Seek support from fellow runners and engage with peers in the computer science field.

7. Perseverance and Dedication: Stay focused, maintain a positive mindset, and keep pushing forward in both endeavors.
