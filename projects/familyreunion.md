summary: "Helped to plan and run a 200+ person family reunion"
---

I played a crucial role in planning a memorable family reunion, actively contributing in various aspects of the event. I took charge of creating a comprehensive guest list, gathering contact information, and sending out invitations to family members, ensuring that everyone was well-informed and included. 

Additionally, I dedicated time and effort to research and recommend suitable venues or locations that met our family's preferences and accommodated the expected number of attendees. My assistance in coordinating transportation arrangements and helping with accommodation bookings made it easier for out-of-town family members to attend the reunion. 

My creative input in organizing activities and entertainment options, tailored to different age groups and interests, brought joy and engagement to the event. My support in budget management and effective communication throughout the planning process significantly contributed to the success of the family reunion, creating lasting memories for everyone involved.
